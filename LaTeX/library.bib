abstract = {We propose an approach to spatial modeling of extreme rainfall, based on max-stable processes fitted using partial duration series and a censored threshold likelihood function. The resulting models are coherent with classical extreme-value theory and allow the consistent treatment of spatial dependence of rainfall using ideas related to those of classical geostatistics. We illustrate the ideas through data from the Val Ferret watershed in the Swiss Alps, based on daily cumulative rainfall totals recorded at 24 stations for four summers, augmented by a longer series from nearby. We compare the fits of different statistical models appropriate for spatial extremes, select that best fitting our data, and compare return level estimates for the total daily rainfall over the stations. The method can be used in other situations to produce simulations needed for hydrological models, and in particular, for the generation of spatially heterogeneous extreme rainfall fields over catchments.},

The Gaussian mixture representation of a multivariate t distribution is used as a starting point to construct two new copulas, the skewed t copula and the grouped t copula, which allow more heterogeneity in the modelling of dependent observations. Extreme value considerations are used to derive two further new copulas: the t extreme value copula is the limiting copula of componentwise maxima of t distributed random vectors; the t lower tail copula is the limiting copula of bivariate observations from a t distribution that are conditioned to lie below some joint threshold that is progressively lowered. Both these copulas may be approximated for practical purposes by simpler, better-known copulas, these being the Gumbel and Clayton copulas respectively.},

@article{Gneiting2007,
abstract = {Scoring rules assess the quality of probabilistic forecasts, by assigning a numerical score based on the predictive distribution and on the event or value that materializes. A scoring rule is proper if the forecaster maximizes the expected score for an observation drawn from the distributionF if he or she issues the probabilistic forecast F, rather than G ≠ F. It is strictly proper if the maximum is unique. In prediction problems, proper scoring rules encourage the forecaster to make careful assessments and to be honest. In estimation problems, strictly proper scoring rules provide attractive loss and utility functions that can be tailored to the problem at hand. This article reviews and develops the theory of proper scoring rules on general probability spaces, and proposes and discusses examples thereof. Proper scoring rules derive from convex functions and relate to information measures, entropy functions, and Bregman divergences. In the case of categorical variables, we prove a rigorous version of the Savage representation. Examples of scoring rules for probabilistic forecasts in the form of predictive densities include the logarithmic, spherical, pseudospherical, and quadratic scores. The continuous ranked probability score applies to probabilistic forecasts that take the form of predictive cumulative distribution functions. It generalizes the absolute error and forms a special case of a new and very general type of score, the energy score. Like many other scoring rules, the energy score admits a kernel representation in terms of negative definite functions, with links to inequalities of Hoeffding type, in both univariate and multivariate settings. Proper scoring rules for quantile and interval forecasts are also discussed. We relate proper scoring rules to Bayes factors and to cross-validation, and propose a novel form of cross-validation known as random-fold cross-validation. A case study on probabilistic weather forecasts in the North American Pacific Northwest illustrates the importance of propriety. We note optimum score approaches to point and quantile estimation, and propose the intuitively appealing interval score as a utility function in interval estimation that addresses width as well as coverage.},

We examine inference under the model and develop tests for independence of extremes of the marginal variables, both when the thresholds are fixed, and when they increase with the sample size. Motivated by results obtained from this model, we give a new and widely applicable characterisation of dependence in the joint tail which includes existing models as special cases. A new parameter which governs the form of dependence is of fundamental importance to this characterisation. By estimating this parameter, we develop a diagnostic test which assesses the applicability of bivariate extreme value joint tail models. The methods are demonstrated through simulation and by analysing two previously published data sets.},

abstract = {Risk assessment for extreme natural phenomena has become increasingly important, and over the past few years the scientific community has realized the importance of considering the spatial or spatio-temporal extent of extreme events. Historically, the GEV and GPD distributions have played an important role in the statistical modeling of extremes at individual locations, but for risk assessment it is crucial to assess dependence between locations: if dependence is strong, extreme events might occur simultaneously at different locations, thereby increasing the overall risk. In this thesis, we construct new dependence models for space-time extremes, based on asymptotically justified arguments, and propose novel inference methods for fitting these models to observations exceeding high thresholds. So far, the modeling of spatial extremes has been limited to fitting max-stable processes to block (usually annual) maxima, regarded as mutually independent. Our threshold-based approach is more efficient and enables more detailed analysis of extremes, but requires a more sophisticated treatment of dependence. The present work also describes how composite likelihoods can be used for inference, establishes the asymptotic distribution of the corresponding estimators, and assesses statistical efficiency for these methods in various contexts. The methodology is illustrated by application to hourly rainfall data from western Switzerland, and enables realistic modeling of their extremal properties.},

This paper extends a model of Schlather (2001) to the space-time framework, and shows how a pairwise censored likelihood can be used for consistent estimation under mild mixing conditions. Estimator efficiency is also assessed and the choice of pairs to be included in the pairwise likelihood is discussed based on computations for simple time series models.

abstract = {The investigation of multivariate generalized Pareto distributions (GPDs) has begun only recently. For further progress with these distributions simulation methods are an important part. We describe several methods of simulating GPDs, beginning with an efficient method for the logistic GPD. The algorithm is based on the Shi transformation, which was already used for the simulation of multivariate extreme value distributions (EVDs) of logistic type. In the sequel another algorithm is presented simulating a broader class of GPDs. Due to its numerical complexity it is only practicably applicable in low dimensions. A method is given to generate unconditional GPD random vectors from conditionally GPD distributed random vectors. A short application of the simulation methods in the analysis of a real hydrological data set concludes the article. The simulation algorithms are available on the author's home page http://statistik.mathematik.uni-wuerzburg.de/{\~{}}michel.},

abstract = {The investigation of multivariate generalized Pareto distributions (GPDs) in the framework of extreme value theory has begun only lately. Recent results show that they can, as in the univariate case, be used in Peaks over Threshold approaches. In this manuscript we investigate the definition of GPDs from Section 5.1 of Falk et al. (2004), which does not differ in the area of interest from those of other authors. We first show some theoretical properties and introduce important examples of GPDs. For the further investigation of these distributions simulation methods are an important part. We describe several methods of simulating GPDs, beginning with an efficient method for the logistic GPD. This algorithm is based on the Shi transformation, which was introduced by Shi (1995) and was used in Stephenson (2003) for the simulation of multivariate extreme value distributions of logistic type. We also present nonparametric and parametric estimation methods in GPD models. We estimate the angular density nonparametrically in arbitrary dimension, where the bivariate case turns out to be a special case. The asymptotic normality of the corresponding estimators is shown. Also in the parametric estimations, which are mainly based on maximum likelihood methods, the asymptotic normality of the estimators is shown under certain regularity conditions. Finally the methods are applied to a real hydrological data set containing water discharges of the rivers Altm{\"{u}}hl and Danube in southern Bavaria.},

abstract = {Methods are given for simulating from symmetric and asymmetric versions of the multivariate logistic distribution, and from other multivariate extreme value distributions based on the well known logistic model. We consider two general approaches. The first approach uses transformations to derive random variables with a joint distribution function from which it is easy to simulate. The second approach derives from a specification of conditionally independent marginal components, conditioning on positive stable random variables. This specification extends to models of nested or hierarchical type and leads to an efficient way of incorporating marginal censoring. The algorithms presented in Sections 2 and 3 are available on request from the author.

abstract = {Estimating the probability of extreme temperature events is difficult because of limited records across time and the need to extrapolate the distributions of these events, as opposed to just the mean, to locations where observations are not available. Another related issue is the need to characterize the uncertainty in the estimated probability of extreme events at different locations. Although the tools for statistical modeling of univariate extremes are well-developed, extending these tools to model spatial extreme data is an active area of research. In this paper, in order to make inference about spatial extreme events, we introduce a new nonparametric model for extremes. We present a Dirichlet-based copula model that is a flexible alternative to parametric copula models such as the normal and t-copula. The proposed modelling approach is fitted using a Bayesian framework that allow us to take into account different sources of uncertainty in the data and models. We apply our methods to annual maximum temperature values in the east-south-central United States.},

One approach is based on modelling exceedances of a random variable over a high threshold with the generalized Pareto (GP) distribution. This has proved to be an important way to apply extreme value theory in practice and is widely used. We introduce a multivariate analogue of the GP distribution and show that it is characterized by each of following two properties: first, exceedances asymptotically have a multivariate GP distribution if and only if maxima asymptotically are extreme value distributed; and second, the multivariate GP distribution is the only one which is preserved under change of exceedance levels.

abstract = {The analysis of spatial extremes requires the joint modeling of a spatial process at a large number of stations. Multivariate extreme value theory can be used to model the joint extremal behavior of environmental data such as precipitation, snow depths or daily temperatures. Max-stable processes are the natural generalization of extremal dependence structures to infinite dimensions arising from the extension of multivariate extreme value theory. However, there have been few works on the threshold approach of max-stable processes. Padoan, Ribatet and Sisson [2010] proposed the maximum composite likelihood approach for fitting max-stable processes to avoid the complexity and unavailability of the multivariate density function. We propose the threshold version of max-stable process estimation and we apply the pairwise composite likelihood method to it. We assume a strict form of condition, so called the second-order regular variation condition, for the distribution satisfying the domain of attraction. To obtain the limit behavior, we also consider the increasing domain structure with stochastic sampling design based on the setting and conditions in Lahiri [2003] and we then establish consistency and asymptotic normality of the estimator for dependence parameter in the threshold method of max-stable processes. The method is studied by simulation and illustrated by the application of temperature data in North Carolina, United States.},

They form a natural class of processes when sample maxima are observed at each site of a spatial process, a problem of particular interest in connection with regional estimation methods in hydrology. A general representation of max-stable processes due to de Haan and Vatan is discussed, and examples are given to show how it may be used to generate explicit examples of max-stable process. As a side-product, it is possible to generate a number of known multivariate extreme value families in this way, and in one case this suggests an extension of the family. The main contribution of the paper, however, is to define two new max-stable stochastic processes, related to the multivariate normal and multivariate t distributions. Statistical estimation and model checking are discussed, and the concepts illustrated by being applied to rainfall data. Keywords.},

In this paper, an alternative methodology for extreme values of univariate time series is developed, by assuming that the time series is Markovian and using bivariate extreme value theory to suggest appropriate models for the transition distributions. A new likelihood representation for threshold methods is presented which we apply to a Markovian time series. An important motivation for developing this kind of theory is the possibility of calculating probability distributions for functionals of extreme events. We address this issue by showing how a theory of compound Poisson limits for additive functionals can be combined with simulation to obtain numerical solutions for problems of practical interest.

abstract = {The extremal coefficients are the natural dependence measures for multivariate extreme value distributions. For an m-variate distribution 2m distinct extremal coefficients of different orders exist; they are closely linked and therefore a complete set of 2m coefficients cannot take any arbitrary values. We give a full characterization of all the sets of extremal coefficients. To this end, we introduce a simple class of extreme value distributions that allows for a 1-1 mapping to the complete sets of extremal coefficients. We construct bounds that higher order extremal coefficients need to satisfy to be consistent with lower order extremal coefficients. These bounds are useful as lower order extremal coefficients are the most easily inferred from data.},

abstract = {Multivariate extreme events are typically modelled using multivariate extreme value distributions. Unfortunately, there exists no finite parametrization for the class of multivariate extreme value distributions. One common approach is to model extreme events using some flexible parametric subclass. This approach has been limited to only two or three dimensions, primarily because suitably flexible high-dimensional parametric models have prohibitively complex density functions. We present an approach that allows a number of popular flexible models to be used in arbitrarily high dimensions. The approach easily handles missing and censored data, and can be employed when modelling componentwise maxima and multivariate threshold exceedances. The approach is based on a representation using conditionally independent marginal components, conditioning on positive stable random variables. We use Bayesian inference, where the conditioning variables are treated as auxiliary variables within Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations. We demonstrate these methods with an application to sea-levels, using data collected at 10 sites on the east coast of England.},

abstract = {In the information system research, a question of particular interest is to interpret and to predict the probability of a firm to adopt a new technology such that market promotions are targeted to only those firms that were more likely to adopt the technology. Typically, there exists significant difference between the observed number of “adopters” and “nonadopters,” which is usually coded as binary response. A critical issue involved in modeling such binary response data is the appropriate choice of link functions in a regression model. In this paper we introduce a new flexible skewed link function for modeling binary response data based on the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution. We show how the proposed GEV links provide more flexible and improved skewed link regression models than the existing skewed links, especially when dealing with imbalance between the observed number of 0's and 1's in a data. The flexibility of the proposed model is illustrated through simulated data sets and a billing data set of the electronic payments system adoption from a Fortune 100 company in 2005.},

@article{Banerjee2008,
abstract = {With scientific data available at geocoded locations, investigators are increasingly turning to spatial process models for carrying out statistical inference. Over the last decade, hierarchical models implemented through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods have become especially popular for spatial modelling, given their flexibility and power to fit models that would be infeasible with classical methods as well as their avoidance of possibly inappropriate asymptotics. However, fitting hierarchical spatial models often involves expensive matrix decompositions whose computational complexity increases in cubic order with the number of spatial locations, rendering such models infeasible for large spatial data sets. This computational burden is exacerbated in multivariate settings with several spatially dependent response variables. It is also aggravated when data are collected at frequent time points and spatiotemporal process models are used. With regard to this challenge, our contribution is to work with what we call predictive process models for spatial and spatiotemporal data. Every spatial (or spatiotemporal) process induces a predictive process model (in fact, arbitrarily many of them). The latter models project process realizations of the former to a lower dimensional subspace, thereby reducing the computational burden. Hence, we achieve the flexibility to accommodate non-stationary, non-Gaussian, possibly multivariate, possibly spatiotemporal processes in the context of large data sets. We discuss attractive theoretical properties of these predictive processes. We also provide a computational template encompassing these diverse settings. Finally, we illustrate the approach with simulated and real data sets.},

abstract = {Extreme value theory finds wide applications in areas such as environmental science, financial strategy of risk management and biomedical data processing. In this thesis, we present two spatial extreme value studies related to weather and climate events observed in space and in time, one of which motivates a novel methodology in constructing continuous spatial process for extreme values. Motivated by finding multiscale spatial dependence in extreme climate studies, we offer a new Bayesian analysis tool for learning about both large scale spatial dependence and microscale dependence. The last chapter presents a novel application of space-time models to synoptic climatology. The first investigation is a development of hierarchical modeling approach for explaining a collection of spatially-referenced time series of extreme values. We assume that the observations follow Generalized Extreme Value(GEV) distributions whose locations and scales are jointly spatially dependent where the dependence is captured using multivariate Markov random field models specified through coregionalization. There are various ways to provide appropriate specifications; we consider four choices. The models can be fitted using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to enable inference for parameters and to provide spatio-temporal predictions. We fit the models to a set of gridded interpolated precipitation data collected over a 50 year period for the Cape Floristic Region in South Africa, summarizing results for what appears to be the best choice of model. In chapter 3, we extend the hierarchical modeling approach for explaining a collection of point-referenced time series of extreme values. Annual maxima are still assumed to follow GEV distributions, with parameters $\mu$, $\sigma$, and $\xi$ specified in the latent stage to reflect underlying spatio-temporal structure. Here, we relax the conditionally independence assumption previously imposed in the first stage hierarchical models for annual maxima. Instead, a continuous spatial process model is proposed to account for spatial dependence which is unexplained by the latent spatio-temporal specifications for the GEV parameters. In addition, we offer an approach to make spatial interpolation for extreme values based on this hierarchical models with smoothed residuals across space. A simulation study is illustrated to investigate the model fitting behavior. Motivated by the findings in extreme climate studies, which is, large scale spatial variations and small scale spatial variations coexist in some extreme climate phenomena, we present a Bayesian spatial modeling approach to make inference of both large scale and small scale spatial dependence in a general spatial setting. In particular, we focus on the investigation of microscale spatial dependence, which is defined as the dependence at distances smaller than the measurement scale of the spatial study. Since microscale spatial variation study often involves data observed at high resolution, we offer several potential solutions to tackle the computational difficulty of 'large n' problem. In the last chapter, the application we focus on is to synoptic climatology where the goal is to develop an array of atmospheric states to capture a collection of distinct circulations. In particular, Self Organizing Maps (SOMs) are one of the recently used techniques in the meteorology community with regard to developing synoptic weather states. Little discussion about this technique has been found in the statistics literature. We introduce the stochasticity in the form of a space-time process model aiming to illuminate and interpret its performance in the context of application to daily data collection. That is, the observed daily state vectors are viewed as a time series of multivariate process realizations which we try to understand under the dimension reduction achieved by the SOM procedure.},

abstract = {Tropospheric ozone is one of six criteria pollutants regulated by the US EPA, and has been linked to respiratory and cardiovascular endpoints and adverse effects on vegetation and ecosystems. Regional photochemical models have been developed to study the impacts of emission reductions on ozone levels. The standard approach is to run the deterministic model under new emission levels and attribute the change in ozone concentration to the emission control strategy. However, running the deterministic model requires substantial computing time, and this approach does not provide a measure of uncertainty for the change in ozone levels. Recently, a reduced form model (RFM) has been proposed to approximate the complex model as a simple function of a few relevant inputs. In this paper, we develop a new statistical approach to make full use of the RFM to study the effects of various control strategies on the probability and magnitude of extreme ozone events. We fuse the model output with monitoring data to calibrate the RFM by modeling the conditional distribution of monitoring data given the RFM using a combination of flexible semiparametric quantile regression for the center of the distribution where data are abundant and a parametric extreme value distribution for the tail where data are sparse. Selected parameters in the conditional distribution are allowed to vary by the RFM value and the spatial location. Also, due to the simplicity of the RFM, we are able to embed the RFM in our Bayesian hierarchical framework to obtain a full posterior for the model input parameters, and propagate this uncertainty to the estimation of the effects of the control strategies. We use the new framework to evaluate three potential control strategies, and find that reducing mobile-source emissions has a larger impact than reducing point-source emissions or a combination of several emission sources.},

The main contribution of this note is to propose such a spectral construction for the extremal t process. Interestingly, the extremal Gaussian process introduced by Schlather (2002) [22] appears as a special case.

@article{Bacro2014,
abstract = {Parametric inference for spatial max-stable processes is difficult since the related likelihoods are unavailable. A composite likelihood approach based on the bivariate distribution of block maxima has been recently proposed. However modeling block maxima is a wasteful approach provided that other information is available. Moreover an approach based on block maxima, typically annual, is unable to take into account the fact that maxima occur or not simultaneously. If time series of, say, daily data are available, then estimation procedures based on exceedances of a high threshold could mitigate such problems. We focus on two approaches for composing likelihoods based on pairs of exceedances. The first one comes from the tail approximation for bivariate distribution proposed by Ledford and Tawn (Biometrika 83:169–187, 1996) when both pairs of observations exceed the fixed threshold. The second one uses the bivariate extension (Rootz{\'{e}}n and Tajvidi in Bernoulli 12:917–930, 2006) of the generalized Pareto distribution which allows to model exceedances when at least one of the components is over the threshold. The two approaches are compared through a simulation study where both processes in a domain of attraction of a max-stable process and max-stable processes are successively considered as time replications, according to different degrees of spatial dependency. Results put forward how the nature of the time replications influences the bias of estimations and highlight the choice of each approach regarding to the strength of the spatial dependencies and the threshold choice.},

abstract = {Quantities with right-skewed distributions are ubiquitous in complex social systems, including political conflict, economics and social networks, and these systems sometimes produce extremely large events. For instance, the 9/11 terrorist events produced nearly 3000 fatalities, nearly six times more than the next largest event. But, was this enormous loss of life statistically unlikely given modern terrorism's historical record? Accurately estimating the probability of such an event is complicated by the large fluctuations in the empirical distribution's upper tail. We present a generic statistical algorithm for making such estimates, which combines semi-parametric models of tail behavior and a non-parametric bootstrap. Applied to a global database of terrorist events, we estimate the worldwide historical probability of observing at least one 9/11-sized or larger event since 1968 to be 11-35{\%}. These results are robust to conditioning on global variations in economic development, domestic versus international events, the type of weapon used and a truncated history that stops at 1998. We then use this procedure to make a data-driven statistical forecast of at least one similar event over the next decade.},

@article{Wadsworth2014,
abstract = {Max-stable processes arise as the only possible nontrivial limits for maxima of affinely normalized identically distributed stochastic processes, and thus form an important class of models for the extreme values of spatial processes. Until recently, inference for max-stable processes has been restricted to the use of pairwise composite likelihoods, due to intractability of higher-dimensional distributions. In this work we consider random fields that are in the domain of attraction of a widely used class of max-stable processes, namely those constructed via manipulation of log-Gaussian random functions. For this class, we exploit limiting d-dimensional multivariate Poisson process intensities of the underlying process for inference on all d-vectors exceeding a high marginal threshold in at least one component, employing a censoring scheme to incorporate information below the marginal threshold. We also consider the d-dimensional distributions for the equivalent max-stable process, and perform full likelihood inference by exploiting the methods of Stephenson {\&} Tawn (2005), where information on the occurrence times of extreme events is shown to dramatically simplify the likelihood. The Stephenson-Tawn likelihood is in fact simply a special case of the censored Poisson process likelihood. We assess the improvements in inference from both methods over pairwise likelihood methodology by simulation.},

abstract = {We propose a robust alternative to principal component analysis (PCA) — named elliptical component analysis (ECA) — for analyzing high dimensional elliptically distributed data. ECA aims at estimating the eigenspace of the covariance matrix of the elliptical data. To cope with the heavy-tailed elliptical distributions, a multivariate rank statistic is exploited. At the model-level, we consider two settings that the leading eigenvectors of the covariance matrix are non-sparse or sparse. Methodologically, we propose ECA procedures corresponding to both non-sparse and sparse settings. Theoretically, we provide both non-asymptotic and asymptotic analysis in quantifying the theoretical performances of ECA. Under the non-sparse setting, we show that ECA's performance is highly related to the effective rank of the covariance matrix. Under the sparse setting, the results are in two folds: (i) We show that the sparse ECA estimator based on a combinatoric program attains the optimal rate of convergence; (ii) Built upon some recent developments in estimating sparse leading eigenvectors, we show that a computationally efficient sparse ECA estimator attains the optimal rate of convergence under a suboptimal scaling.},

abstract = {New technologies are rapidly changing the way we collect, archive, analyze, and share scientific data. For example, over the next several years it is estimated that more than one billion autonomous sensors will be deployed over large spatial and temporal scales, and will gather vast quantities of data. Networks of human observers play a major role in gathering scientific data, and whether in astronomy, meteorology, or observations of nature, they continue to contribute significantly. In this paper we present an innovative use of the Internet and information technologies that better enhances the opportunity for citizens to contribute their observations to science and the conservation of bird populations. eBird is building a web-enabled community of bird watchers who collect, manage, and store their observations in a globally accessible unified database. Through its development as a tool that addresses the needs of the birding community, eBird sustains and grows participation. Birders, scientists, and conservationists are using eBird data worldwide to better understand avian biological patterns and the environmental and anthropogenic factors that influence them. Developing and shaping this network over time, eBird has created a near real-time avian data resource producing millions of observations per year. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The analysis of spatial extremes requires the joint modeling of a spatial process at a large number of stations and max-stable processes have been developed as a class of stochastic processes suitable for studying spatial extremes. Spatial dependence structure in the extreme value analysis can be measured by max-stable processes. However, there have been few works on the threshold approach of max-stable processes. We propose a threshold version of max-stable process estimation and we apply the pairwise composite likelihood method by Padoan et al. (2010) to estimate spatial dependence parameters. It is of interest to establish limit behavior of the estimates based on the settings of increasing domain asymptotics with stochastic sampling design. Two different types of asymptotic normality are drawn under the second-order regular variation condition for the distribution satisfying the domain of attraction. The theoretical property of dependence parameter estimators in limiting sense is implemented by simulation and a choice of optimal threshold is discussed in this paper.},

abstract = {Current dependence models for spatial extremes are based upon max-stable processes. Within this class, there are few inferentially viable models available, and we propose one further model. More problematic are the restrictive assumptions that must be made when using max-stable processes to model dependence for spatial extremes: it must be assumed that the dependence structure of the observed extremes is compatible with a limiting model that holds for all events more extreme than those that have already occurred. This problem has long been acknowledged in the context of finite-dimensional multivariate extremes, in particular when data display dependence at observable levels, but are independent in the limit. We propose a flexible class of models that is suitable for such data in a spatial context. In addition, we consider the situation where the extremal dependence structure may vary with distance. We apply our models to spatially referenced significant wave height data from the North Sea, finding evidence that their extremal structure is not compatible with a limiting dependence model.},

We focus on the deviance information criterion. The joint estimation takes into account all dependence structure of the parameters' posterior distributions in our chosen model selection criteria. Two Monte Carlo studies are conducted to show that model identification improves when the model parameters are jointly estimated.

abstract = {Customary modeling for continuous point-referenced data assumes a Gaussian process that is often taken to be stationary. When such models are fitted within a Bayesian framework, the unknown parameters of the process are assumed to be random, so a random Gaussian process results. Here we propose a novel spatial Dirichlet process mixture model to produce a random spatial process that is neither Gaussian nor stationary. We first develop a spatial Dirichlet process model for spatial data and discuss its properties. Because of familiar limitations associated with direct use of Dirichlet process models, we introduce mixing by convolving this process with a pure error process. We then examine properties of models created through such Dirichlet process mixing. In the Bayesian framework, we implement posterior inference using Gibbs sampling. Spatial prediction raises interesting questions, but these can be handled. Finally, we illustrate the approach using simulated data, as well as a dataset involving precipitation measurements over the Languedoc-Roussillon region in southern France.},

@article{Albert1993,
abstract = {A vast literature in statistics, biometrics, and econometrics is concerned with the analysis of binary and polychotomous response data. The classical approach fits a categorical response regression model using maximum likelihood, and inferences about the model are based on the associated asymptotic theory. The accuracy of classical confidence statements is questionable for small sample sizes. In this article, exact Bayesian methods for modeling categorical response data are developed using the idea of data augmentation. The general approach can be summarized as follows. The probit regression model for binary outcomes is seen to have an underlying normal regression structure on latent continuous data. Values of the latent data can be simulated from suitable truncated normal distributions. If the latent data are known, then the posterior distribution of the parameters can be computed using standard results for normal linear models. Draws from this posterior are used to sample new latent data, and the process is iterated with Gibbs sampling. This data augmentation approach provides a general framework for analyzing binary regression models. It leads to the same simplification achieved earlier for censored regression models. Under the proposed framework, the class of probit regression models can be enlarged by using mixtures of normal distributions to model the latent data. In this normal mixture class, one can investigate the sensitivity of the parameter estimates to the choice of "link function," which relates the linear regression estimate to the fitted probabilities. In addition, this approach allows one to easily fit Bayesian hierarchical models. One specific model considered here reflects the belief that the vector of regression coefficients lies on a smaller dimension linear subspace. The methods can also be generalized to multinomial response models with {\$}J {\textgreater} 2{\$} categories. In the ordered multinomial model, the J categories are ordered and a model is written linking the cumulative response probabilities with the linear regression structure. In the unordered multinomial model, the latent variables have a multivariate normal distribution with unknown variance-covariance matrix. For both multinomial models, the data augmentation method combined with Gibbs sampling is outlined. This approach is especially attractive for the multivariate probit model, where calculating the likelihood can be difficult.},

@article{Cooley2012a,
abstract = {Phenomena such as air pollution levels are of greatest interest when observations are large, but standard prediction methods are not specifically designed for large observations. We propose a method, rooted in extreme value theory, which approximates the conditional distribution of an unobserved component of a random vector given large observed values. Specifically, for Z=(Z1,{\ldots},Zd)T and Z−d=(Z1,{\ldots},Zd−1)T, the method approximates the conditional distribution of [Zd|Z−d=z−d] when ∥z−d∥{\textgreater}r∗. The approach is based on the assumption that Z is a multivariate regularly varying random vector of dimension d. The conditional distribution approximation relies on knowledge of the angular measure of Z, which provides explicit structure for dependence in the distribution's tail. As the method produces a predictive distribution rather than just a point predictor, one can answer any question posed about the quantity being predicted, and, in particular, one can assess how well the extreme behavior is represented. Using a fitted model for the angular measure, we apply our method to nitrogen dioxide measurements in metropolitan Washington DC. We obtain a predictive distribution for the air pollutant at a location given the air pollutant's measurements at four nearby locations and given that the norm of the vector of the observed measurements is large.},

@article{Kim2005,
abstract = {In many problems in geostatistics the response variable of interest is strongly related to the underlying geology of the spatial location. In these situations there is often little correlation in the responses found in different rock strata, so the underlying covariance structure shows sharp changes at the boundaries of the rock types. Conventional stationary and nonstationary spatial methods are inappropriate, because they typically assume that the covariance between points is a smooth function of distance. In this article we propose a generic method for the analysis of spatial data with sharp changes in the underlying covariance structure. Our method works by automatically decomposing the spatial domain into disjoint regions within which the process is assumed to be stationary, but the data are assumed independent across regions. Uncertainty in the number of disjoint regions, their shapes, and the model within regions is dealt with in a fully Bayesian fashion. We illustrate our approach on a previously unpublished dataset relating to soil permeability of the Schneider Buda oil field in Wood County, Texas.},

abstract = {Storm surge, the onshore rush of sea water caused by the high winds and low pressure associated with a hurricane, can compound the effects of inland flooding caused by rainfall, leading to loss of property and loss of life for residents of coastal areas. Numerical ocean models are essential for creating storm surge forecasts for coastal areas. These models are driven primarily by the surface wind forcings. Currently, the gridded wind fields used by ocean models are specified by deterministic formulas that are based on the central pressure and location of the storm center. While these equations incorporate important physical knowledge about the structure of hurricane surface wind fields, they cannot always capture the asymmetric and dynamic nature of a hurricane. A new Bayesian multivariate spatial statistical modeling framework is introduced combining data with physical knowledge about the wind fields to improve the estimation of the wind vectors. Many spatial models assume the data follow a Gaussian distribution. However, this may be overly-restrictive for wind fields data which often display erratic behavior, such as sudden changes in time or space. In this paper we develop a semiparametric multivariate spatial model for these data. Our model builds on the stick-breaking prior, which is frequently used in Bayesian modeling to capture uncertainty in the parametric form of an outcome. The stick-breaking prior is extended to the spatial setting by assigning each location a different, unknown distribution, and smoothing the distributions in space with a series of kernel functions. This semiparametric spatial model is shown to improve prediction compared to usual Bayesian Kriging methods for the wind field of Hurricane Ivan.},

As a result, there is great interest in studying the changes over time in the probability and magnitude of heat waves. In this paper we propose a hierarchical Bayesian model for serially-dependent extreme temperatures. We assume the marginal temperature distribution follows the generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) above a location-specific threshold, and capture dependence between subsequent days using a transformed max-stable process. Our model allows both the parameters in the marginal GPD and the temporal dependence function to change over time. This allows Bayesian inference on the change in likelihood of a heat wave. We apply this methodology to daily high temperatures in nine cities in the western US for 1979–2010. Our analysis reveals increases in the probability of a heat wave in several US cities.

abstract = {Extreme environmental phenomena such as major precipitation events manifestly exhibit spatial dependence. Max-stable processes are a class of asymptotically-justified models that are capable of representing spatial dependence among extreme values. While these models satisfy modeling requirements, they are limited in their utility because their corresponding joint likelihoods are unknown for more than a trivial number of spatial locations, preventing, in particular, Bayesian analyses. In this paper, we propose a new random effects model to account for spatial dependence. We show that our specification of the random effect distribution leads to a max-stable process that has the popular Gaussian extreme value process (GEVP) as a limiting case.
